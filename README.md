# boiii-auto-favorite-server
Fetch all the servers from the IW4MAdmin api and save it to favorites

Just drag the python script/exe to where boiii is installed and it'll do it's thing

It will overwrite your existing favorites

Some servers will appear as not responding despite them being on the list, can't do much about that (i think)
