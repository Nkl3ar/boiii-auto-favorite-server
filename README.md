# boiii-auto-favorite-server
Fetch all the servers from the IW4MAdmin api and save it to favorites

Just download it to where boiii.exe is and run it

It will overwrite your existing favorites

Some servers will appear as not responding despite them being on the list, can't do much about that (i think)

Exe was generated with auto-py-to-exe
